First vehicle I've had with Android Auto support (or Car Play but I haven't owned a iPhone since the iPhone 4, just personal preference).Anyways when I first got it I couldn't not get Android Auto to work. I tried everything I could find online about the problem and you can find plenty of people that have/had trouble getting it to work in their Honda CR-V (ironic since the infotainment system runs on android). Tried doing a full factory reset on the infotainment system, turning on USB debugging in dev settings, and the 2 dif USB type C to USB type A cable I had. No matter it would not work. My phone would charge when plugged in but that's it. A message is supposed to pop up on the infotainment system asking if you want to enable android auto.I bought this cable as a last resort. I made sure to get a USB 2.0 and NOT a USB 3.0 type C to USB type A cable. Didn't think it would make a difference. Got in the car, turned it on, plugged the cable into the car, then into my phone, and BAM the \"do you want to enable android auto\" message instantly pops up on the infotainment system. And it works perfectly. Love it.",

Overall, the cable does its job well, but there are a few aspects worth mentioning.First, let's talk about the positives. The cable functions reliably and effectively connects my USB A devices to my USB C devices. I haven't experienced any connectivity issues or data transfer problems so far, which is crucial when it comes to cables.However, one notable drawback of this cable is its stiff jacket. The cable's outer covering feels rigid and inflexible, making it a bit challenging to maneuver and position as desired. Although this stiffness can be attributed to the cable's durability, it may be a point of concern for those seeking a more flexible and pliable option.That being said, if you're primarily looking for a durable cable that can withstand some wear and tear, this might be a suitable choice for you. The cable's build quality appears to be solid, and it feels sturdy enough to last for an extended period. Just keep in mind that the trade-off for this durability is the cable's rigidity.",

All I know is that I bought this charger as a temporary replacement for my earbud case since the original charger stopped working (and ironically, the charger cables on the official brand site are completely sold out, hence turning to Amazon for a generic one). I have an older, nearly falling apart version of the earbuds that uses a different charger type, and I charge it with a generic charging cable--I haven't had a problem in the 2 years I've been using it. Hence my optimism doing the same for the new earbuds. I opened it as soon as it arrived and everything seemed great. I plugged it into my case and it charged just fine; in fact, it was just what I needed at the start. Cue a couple hours later.I unplugged the case, as it was fully charged, and was using my earbuds when all of a sudden--after about an hour of it being unplugged--there was a LOUD pop, sparks flew out of the case, and it began to smoke. I hurried and disposed of the case because obviously, but was confused because HOW??? The only reasons that come to mind is that the charger and earbud case just weren't compatible or I was sent a faulty charging cable. I don't know, I'm not a battery expert, but I DO know that lithium batteries aren't supposed to randomly explode within an hour of charging them.

I would like a longer charging cable for my iPad Pro and I gambled, since it says it will work with another Apple product, (the MacBook), and lost. The cable might just as well be a piece of string with usb plugs. There is no response of any kind when I plug it in. Even an off brand lightning cable will say \u201cthis device may not work with this cable \u201c. Returning it would just be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Giving it two stars is working on the assumption that it may actually work on \u201cany Type-C enabled device\u201d... except the iPad Pro! So, be careful and don\u2019t get your hopes up. Especially if you want to use it for an Apple product.To be fair I could not find anywhere it said it WOULD work with the iPad Pro. \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1fUPDATE: I does work! The charging cable that came with the iPad is instantly recognized so when I plugged the new one in and it didn\u2019t immediately work I made the mistaken assumption that my new iPad just wouldn\u2019t recognize this Non-Apple cord. It actually takes about 7-8 seconds to wake up and begin charging with this generic cable.So, 7 seconds is just fine with me and assuming it won\u2019t burn out like the old Lightning cables did.I couldn\u2019t be happier.If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!",

Bought 6 foot cord already and now buying more to lay around the house at my desk, sofa, recliner, and in my car. Easier than carrying one set of cords around. Found the 10 foot cord was too long which reduces charging speed, especially when paired up with lower mAh charger, or does not power the device at all. Pair a 10 footer only if you have a high capacity charger. Forget about QI wireless charging which have a higher charging demand. Disadvantage of using cords with plastic type covers vs braided type covers is that they are easier to tangle and inserts wrinkles went tightly wrapped and folded in. I installed a Velcro cord wrap you can buy at a home improvement store to avoid wrinkles when wrapping and storing the cord. The connector tip do break off if you step on them.",

My music kept playing in the background, but the screen was useless. I had to force shut down, and when I restarted, everything was fine.

    "text": "works really well. More versatile than standard USB-C cables as these can be plugged into the more common USB \"A\" found on computers and most phone chargers.  This eliminates the need for me to carry a separate USB-C charger when travelling.NOTE that it will not charge as quickly as a standard USB-C charger with a USB-C cable, but charges quickly enough.Using the \"AMPERE\" phone app, the attached pics show that the AMPERE app measuring the charging of an ALMOST fully charged LG Nexus 5X phone charging at the max rate of 400 mAh with the LG Charger and OEM LG USB-C cable.The other picture showing the max charging rate of 340 mAh is with the Amazon USB-A=> USB-C and a OLYTEK travel charging using the standard USB-A outlet.  So, the AMAZON cable is charging about 85% as quickly as the OEM LG USB-c charger and cable.NOTE 2= when a phone is mostly charged, the charging rate slows down.  If the phone's battery was used up the rates would be much higher.Seems to be of very high quality and the white cables make them easy to locate in a bag.",

If you hold your phone while its plugged in, it will continually drop the cable on you. The rigidity doesn't allow the cable to bend as you move, and forces the connector to flex back and forth making it wiggle out of the port.I have one of these in my car, wired into the dash and comes out at the phone mount. The setup is static and the wire doesn't wiggle free. So, for that setup its perfect.  But I have another loose wire in the cab for the passenger, and you have to hold the cable to keep it from coming out.I also use another for connecting a laptop to my network.

Whenever I plug it into my cell phone (ZTE MAX) the phone continually \"dings\" on and off because the cable is very loose in the USB C port.  The OEM cable does not cause this to happen, neither does the OEM cable from a Samsung phone I have.I  have several of this brand of charger cable for my Apple products, both with the 30 pin connector and the lightning connector, and always recommend them over any other brand including Apple's branded cables, as these have worked just as good for a fraction of the price, and honestly, have lasted longer than the Apple OEM ones. Which makes me think that this is just an isolated issue.I did not return it because if I use it as a desktop charger, where it's not moving in the vehicle, it does not chime on and off all to often.  I assuming that its because it's stationary and the plug is not wiggling around.I would still recommend buying Amazonbasics cables over the OEM for any manufacturer, and especially over the 100's of non OEM brands from any retailer, as they not only cost more, but in my experciance are subpar, and not orth buying even at 1/2 the cost of the Amazon basics.",

I have to contort the phone so that the USB-C is at a slight angle to get it to charge at all. Meanwhile, the absurdly short cords still work fine, so I know it's this cord and not my devices.It's not a bad price, and maybe other cords would also fail after about a year.
