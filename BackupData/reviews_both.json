First vehicle I've had with Android Auto support (or Car Play but I haven't owned a iPhone since the iPhone 4, just personal preference).Anyways when I first got it I couldn't not get Android Auto to work. I tried everything I could find online about the problem and you can find plenty of people that have/had trouble getting it to work in their Honda CR-V (ironic since the infotainment system runs on android). Tried doing a full factory reset on the infotainment system, turning on USB debugging in dev settings, and the 2 dif USB type C to USB type A cable I had. No matter it would not work. My phone would charge when plugged in but that's it. A message is supposed to pop up on the infotainment system asking if you want to enable android auto.I bought this cable as a last resort. I made sure to get a USB 2.0 and NOT a USB 3.0 type C to USB type A cable. Didn't think it would make a difference. Got in the car, turned it on, plugged the cable into the car, then into my phone, and BAM the \"do you want to enable android auto\" message instantly pops up on the infotainment system. And it works perfectly. Love it.",

    "text": "I recently purchased the Amazon Basics USB A to USB C cable and wanted to share my experience with fellow shoppers. Overall, the cable does its job well, but there are a few aspects worth mentioning.First, let's talk about the positives. The cable functions reliably and effectively connects my USB A devices to my USB C devices. I haven't experienced any connectivity issues or data transfer problems so far, which is crucial when it comes to cables.However, one notable drawback of this cable is its stiff jacket. The cable's outer covering feels rigid and inflexible, making it a bit challenging to maneuver and position as desired. Although this stiffness can be attributed to the cable's durability, it may be a point of concern for those seeking a more flexible and pliable option.That being said, if you're primarily looking for a durable cable that can withstand some wear and tear, this might be a suitable choice for you. The cable's build quality appears to be solid, and it feels sturdy enough to last for an extended period. Just keep in mind that the trade-off for this durability is the cable's rigidity.",

    "text": "This charging system really is very useful. This is the one single Amazon find that I have proselytized to others and encouraged them to use.  I've used this type of charging system for years.  I love it.  This particular order was to replace a couple cables and plugs that have eventually disappeared or were damaged over the years. I hesitated to write this review; not because it's bad --  the product is great. But because i find the super-gushing reviews where everything is perfect (insert multiple exclamation points!!) to be sus.  And today I'm writing a review that I'm afraid will sound gushing. The two parts are (a) the metal head/plug that stays in your phone, plus (b) charging cable with a magnetic connection the little metal head. The system includes multiple small metal heads for USB-C, iPhone Lightning, and micro-USB. These insert into the phone or device and stay there, although you can remove them at any time if needed. The cable has a magnetic end that automatically snaps to the head to connect and charge it.Pro:- One-handed operation -- Really simple & easy to connect the charge cable to your phone, every time.  You can do it one handed if needed; just get the magnetic end of the cable close and it snaps in place. I can plug in the cable in the dark or while bouncing down the road in a car.- One cable to rule them all --  I have devices that use UBS-C, and devices that use Apple Lightning and others with Micro-USB.  This system allows me to use one cable for all three. I only need to carry one cable rather than three cables for three (or more) devices.- Prevents damage to charge port -- The magnetic connection is strong enough to hold the weight of my phone if i lift it gently, but it will become disconnected if I happen to trip over the cable or pull hard for whatever reason.  This helps to prevent damage to the phone's connection port that can occur if a normal cable is pushed or pulled too hard to the side while connected to the port.- reduces wear & limits pocket lint from clogging the phone's charge port -- yah, this is minor; since the head/plug stays in your phone, it fills the charging port and mostly blocks dirt, dirt, lint, water, whatever from getting into the charge port.Con:- Charging only -- These cables do not include transfer data. ...on the plus side, you can connect to a public (eg: airport) charge port without fear of your data being accessed.  At least not through the cable.- Limits Fast Charging -- Occasionally, my phone has performed fast-charging through the magnetic connection, but not usually.  Personally, that is fine with me. Normally I'm near a charger long enough (overnight) that I don't utilize the fast-charging feature.- Sometimes need to remove the head/plug -- You may need to remove the metal head before taking off a phone case.  but you would need to unplug a normal cable too.  Likewise, if you have to borrow a normal cable, then you would also need to remove the head.Thanks for reading; hope this helps someone!",

Second, this sheet showed 3 types of cords, but it was not clear which one I actually received. Finally, I tried the micro head on a waterproof speaker which has an inset plug. The head on these cords is much larger than a typical core and it did not fit properly into the opening. It was close, so I pushed a little harder, but still not a good connection, so I tried to remove. Of course it disconnected at the magnet and left the charging head in the device. In trying to remove the head it broke off in the device. Fortunately there was a tiny piece sticking out that I could grab with needle nose pliars.

You can now attach the charging cables with only one hand instead of two.  I leave a cable connected to the PC and one to a wall outlet charger.  I initially didn't think much about the swivel type magnetic head, but it actually allows the cable to keep from binding automatically.  Neat.It is great to receive an assortment of magnetic USB heads.  This gives you more options on connecting to different devices.  The cables appear flexible and sturdy.  Maybe needlessly so.  There will not be a lot of strain at all when using these.  They also plug in firmly to a USB port.  There is a small blue LED light on the device end of the cable.  It sort of gives it a Hi-Tech vibe.I am sure I will find more devices that can take advantage of this cool product.  Or even purchase new devices that can connect with these.

This product helps with those issues because the connections are magnetic, and allows for a wide range of mothing at the connector, keeping pressure off the cable itself.The magnets are strong, so the cables don't fall off easily and therefore stay connected.The box contains three different-length braided cables, three USB C adapters, three micro USB adapters, 3 apple type adapters, an organizer for the adapters, a tool to remove the adapters, a tool to remove the adapters, cable ties, and a bag.The instructions state to clean the magnetic connectors, to ensure good contact.I have only used this a few days, we will see how this works over time.",

It protects the charging ports from constant plugging/unplugging and dust build up.2.  I leave the 3 charging cables at various locations in the house (office, kitchen, bedroom, etc). My 9 devices can then connect to any of the 3 cables at anytine, thus not having to deal with separate wall plugs for each device.3.  charging process is so much easier, no more fumbling in the dark. The magnetic cable connect to the tips with a satisfying click.4. The end of the charging cable can swivel 360 degrees & bend to 90 degrees for better convenience & ergonomics. There is a LED at the connector that light blue to indicate power.5.  Reduces cables & wall plugs clutter by consolidation. The same cable can now charges 3 different type of connector.  For example, you can charge an Android phone, then an iPad, and then a flashlight without unplugging or changing anything. One handed operation to connect to a new device and you're done!!!",

I have an older, nearly falling apart version of the earbuds that uses a different charger type, and I charge it with a generic charging cable--I haven't had a problem in the 2 years I've been using it. Hence my optimism doing the same for the new earbuds. I opened it as soon as it arrived and everything seemed great. I plugged it into my case and it charged just fine; in fact, it was just what I needed at the start. Cue a couple hours later.I unplugged the case, as it was fully charged, and was using my earbuds when all of a sudden--after about an hour of it being unplugged--there was a LOUD pop, sparks flew out of the case, and it began to smoke. I hurried and disposed of the case because obviously, but was confused because HOW??? The only reasons that come to mind is that the charger and earbud case just weren't compatible or I was sent a faulty charging cable. I don't know, I'm not a battery expert, but I DO know that lithium batteries aren't supposed to randomly explode within an hour of charging them.

I would like a longer charging cable for my iPad Pro and I gambled, since it says it will work with another Apple product, (the MacBook), and lost. The cable might just as well be a piece of string with usb plugs. There is no response of any kind when I plug it in. Even an off brand lightning cable will say \u201cthis device may not work with this cable \u201c. Returning it would just be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Giving it two stars is working on the assumption that it may actually work on \u201cany Type-C enabled device\u201d... except the iPad Pro! So, be careful and don\u2019t get your hopes up.

The charging cable that came with the iPad is instantly recognized so when I plugged the new one in and it didn\u2019t immediately work I made the mistaken assumption that my new iPad just wouldn\u2019t recognize this Non-Apple cord.

Bought 6 foot cord already and now buying more to lay around the house at my desk, sofa, recliner, and in my car. Easier than carrying one set of cords around. Found the 10 foot cord was too long which reduces charging speed, especially when paired up with lower mAh charger, or does not power the device at all. Pair a 10 footer only if you have a high capacity charger. Forget about QI wireless charging which have a higher charging demand. Disadvantage of using cords with plastic type covers vs braided type covers is that they are easier to tangle and inserts wrinkles went tightly wrapped and folded in. I installed a Velcro cord wrap you can buy at a home improvement store to avoid wrinkles when wrapping and storing the cord. The connector tip do break off if you step on them.",

Very good first impressions.  Upon opening the lilttle black box, I saw a card offering the afore mentioned credit in exchange for a review.  Next was two little sealed baggies.  At the bottom was the instruction manual.  I tore open the two baggies.  The headphones were in one.  In the other, ear bud accessories spilled out and rolled off my desk.  The baggies should be resealable so you can open an close the bag and not destroy it upon opening.The headphones were easy to pair to my phone.  The sound quality is very good.I would suggest that they proofread the copy, on both the instruction booklet and the review card.",

If you hold your phone while its plugged in, it will continually drop the cable on you. The rigidity doesn't allow the cable to bend as you move, and forces the connector to flex back and forth making it wiggle out of the port.I have one of these in my car, wired into the dash and comes out at the phone mount. The setup is static and the wire doesn't wiggle free. So, for that setup its perfect.

The OEM cable does not cause this to happen, neither does the OEM cable from a Samsung phone I have.I  have several of this brand of charger cable for my Apple products, both with the 30 pin connector and the lightning connector, and always recommend them over any other brand including Apple's branded cables, as these have worked just as good for a fraction of the price, and honestly, have lasted longer than the Apple OEM ones. Which makes me think that this is just an isolated issue.I did not return it because if I use it as a desktop charger, where it's not moving in the vehicle, it does not chime on and off all to often.  I assuming that its because it's stationary and the plug is not wiggling around.I would still recommend buying Amazonbasics cables over the OEM for any manufacturer, and especially over the 100's of non OEM brands from any retailer, as they not only cost more, but in my experciance are subpar, and not orth buying even at 1/2 the cost of the Amazon basics.",

I have to contort the phone so that the USB-C is at a slight angle to get it to charge at all.

I wouldn't recommend buying if you're not willing to put up with having to wrap the cord around your phone so as to bend it so as to complete the circuit so your phone will charge.  They do charge at a reasonable rate, not as fast as the manufacturer's cord, but if you do keep the cord wrapped up tightly so it will actually charge then it will charge your phone faster than the cheap ones you can buy at your local corner store.  Again, every single cord I bought had this issue, so it is a problem with the cord itself, and they do work but you have to sort of position your cord in a manner so your phone will actually charge.  Do not think it is worth the money, I completely regret purchasing these cords, would buy your other option if it was between these and that.",

It will last much longer than the plastic coating. But if you just need a cheap USB C cable, this should do for most devices.",
