{"asin": "B01GGKYKQM", "text": "I got a 2020 Honda CR-V a few weeks ago. First vehicle I've had with Android Auto support (or Car Play but I haven't owned a iPhone since the iPhone 4, just personal preference).Anyways when I first got it I couldn't not get Android Auto to work. I tried everything I could find online about the problem and you can find plenty of people that have/had trouble getting it to work in their Honda CR-V (ironic since the infotainment system runs on android). Tried doing a full factory reset on the infotainment system, turning on USB debugging in dev settings, and the 2 dif USB type C to USB type A cable I had. No matter it would not work. My phone would charge when plugged in but that's it. A message is supposed to pop up on the infotainment system asking if you want to enable android auto.I bought this cable as a last resort. I made sure to get a USB 2.0 and NOT a USB 3.0 type C to USB type A cable. Didn't think it would make a difference. Got in the car, turned it on, plugged the cable into the car, then into my phone, and BAM the \"do you want to enable android auto\" message instantly pops up on the infotainment system. And it works perfectly. Love it.", "title": "Couldn't get Android Auto to work in my new car, this cable did the trick!", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2023", "verified": true, "rating": "5.0"},

{"asin": "B01GGKYKQM", "text": "I recently purchased the Amazon Basics USB A to USB C cable and wanted to share my experience with fellow shoppers. Overall, the cable does its job well, but there are a few aspects worth mentioning.First, let's talk about the positives. The cable functions reliably and effectively connects my USB A devices to my USB C devices. I haven't experienced any connectivity issues or data transfer problems so far, which is crucial when it comes to cables.However, one notable drawback of this cable is its stiff jacket. The cable's outer covering feels rigid and inflexible, making it a bit challenging to maneuver and position as desired. Although this stiffness can be attributed to the cable's durability, it may be a point of concern for those seeking a more flexible and pliable option.That being said, if you're primarily looking for a durable cable that can withstand some wear and tear, this might be a suitable choice for you. The cable's build quality appears to be solid, and it feels sturdy enough to last for an extended period. Just keep in mind that the trade-off for this durability is the cable's rigidity.", "title": "Reliable Cable with Stiff Jacket", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on June 2, 2023", "verified": true, "rating": "3.0"},
