First vehicle I've had with Android Auto support (or Car Play but I haven't owned a iPhone since the iPhone 4, just personal preference).Anyways when I first got it I couldn't not get Android Auto to work. I tried everything I could find online about the problem and you can find plenty of people that have/had trouble getting it to work in their Honda CR-V (ironic since the infotainment system runs on android). Tried doing a full factory reset on the infotainment system, turning on USB debugging in dev settings, and the 2 dif USB type C to USB type A cable I had. No matter it would not work. My phone would charge when plugged in but that's it. A message is supposed to pop up on the infotainment system asking if you want to enable android auto.I bought this cable as a last resort. I made sure to get a USB 2.0 and NOT a USB 3.0 type C to USB type A cable. Didn't think it would make a difference. Got in the car, turned it on, plugged the cable into the car, then into my phone, and BAM the \"do you want to enable android auto\" message instantly pops up on the infotainment system. And it works perfectly. Love it.",

    "text": "I recently purchased the Amazon Basics USB A to USB C cable and wanted to share my experience with fellow shoppers. Overall, the cable does its job well, but there are a few aspects worth mentioning.First, let's talk about the positives. The cable functions reliably and effectively connects my USB A devices to my USB C devices. I haven't experienced any connectivity issues or data transfer problems so far, which is crucial when it comes to cables.However, one notable drawback of this cable is its stiff jacket. The cable's outer covering feels rigid and inflexible, making it a bit challenging to maneuver and position as desired. Although this stiffness can be attributed to the cable's durability, it may be a point of concern for those seeking a more flexible and pliable option.That being said, if you're primarily looking for a durable cable that can withstand some wear and tear, this might be a suitable choice for you. The cable's build quality appears to be solid, and it feels sturdy enough to last for an extended period. Just keep in mind that the trade-off for this durability is the cable's rigidity.",

    "text": "This charging system really is very useful. This is the one single Amazon find that I have proselytized to others and encouraged them to use.  I've used this type of charging system for years.  I love it.  This particular order was to replace a couple cables and plugs that have eventually disappeared or were damaged over the years. I hesitated to write this review; not because it's bad --  the product is great. But because i find the super-gushing reviews where everything is perfect (insert multiple exclamation points!!) to be sus.  And today I'm writing a review that I'm afraid will sound gushing. The two parts are (a) the metal head/plug that stays in your phone, plus (b) charging cable with a magnetic connection the little metal head. The system includes multiple small metal heads for USB-C, iPhone Lightning, and micro-USB. These insert into the phone or device and stay there, although you can remove them at any time if needed. The cable has a magnetic end that automatically snaps to the head to connect and charge it.Pro:- One-handed operation -- Really simple & easy to connect the charge cable to your phone, every time.  You can do it one handed if needed; just get the magnetic end of the cable close and it snaps in place. I can plug in the cable in the dark or while bouncing down the road in a car.- One cable to rule them all --  I have devices that use UBS-C, and devices that use Apple Lightning and others with Micro-USB.  This system allows me to use one cable for all three. I only need to carry one cable rather than three cables for three (or more) devices.- Prevents damage to charge port -- The magnetic connection is strong enough to hold the weight of my phone if i lift it gently, but it will become disconnected if I happen to trip over the cable or pull hard for whatever reason.  This helps to prevent damage to the phone's connection port that can occur if a normal cable is pushed or pulled too hard to the side while connected to the port.- reduces wear & limits pocket lint from clogging the phone's charge port -- yah, this is minor; since the head/plug stays in your phone, it fills the charging port and mostly blocks dirt, dirt, lint, water, whatever from getting into the charge port.Con:- Charging only -- These cables do not include transfer data. ...on the plus side, you can connect to a public (eg: airport) charge port without fear of your data being accessed.  At least not through the cable.- Limits Fast Charging -- Occasionally, my phone has performed fast-charging through the magnetic connection, but not usually.  Personally, that is fine with me. Normally I'm near a charger long enough (overnight) that I don't utilize the fast-charging feature.- Sometimes need to remove the head/plug -- You may need to remove the metal head before taking off a phone case.  but you would need to unplug a normal cable too.  Likewise, if you have to borrow a normal cable, then you would also need to remove the head.Thanks for reading; hope this helps someone!",

Second, this sheet showed 3 types of cords, but it was not clear which one I actually received. Finally, I tried the micro head on a waterproof speaker which has an inset plug. The head on these cords is much larger than a typical core and it did not fit properly into the opening. It was close, so I pushed a little harder, but still not a good connection, so I tried to remove. Of course it disconnected at the magnet and left the charging head in the device. In trying to remove the head it broke off in the device. Fortunately there was a tiny piece sticking out that I could grab with needle nose pliars.

You can now attach the charging cables with only one hand instead of two.  I leave a cable connected to the PC and one to a wall outlet charger.  I initially didn't think much about the swivel type magnetic head, but it actually allows the cable to keep from binding automatically.  Neat.It is great to receive an assortment of magnetic USB heads.  This gives you more options on connecting to different devices.  The cables appear flexible and sturdy.  Maybe needlessly so.  There will not be a lot of strain at all when using these.  They also plug in firmly to a USB port.  There is a small blue LED light on the device end of the cable.  It sort of gives it a Hi-Tech vibe.I am sure I will find more devices that can take advantage of this cool product.  Or even purchase new devices that can connect with these.

No more bending, fraying and having to purchase spare cords in the foreseeable future.The pack comes with two 78\u201d long, fiber-encased (not plastic) and very flexible cords, as well as two sets of three different tips (six in total) to use with pretty much all kinds of phones, tablets and other electronics, and the same cord can be used will all of them as the connections are magnetized. I leave the plugs attached to my Samsung phone and iPad, so it\u2019s extremely easy and convenient to simply attach the magnet end of the cord to the plugs, without having to wiggle them in place. These cords charge at roughly the same speed than regular cords do, so I have not noticed a significant difference.I cannot tell how durable they are, but I\u2019ve been using them daily for weeks and they remain in pristine condition, with no noticeable deterioration.

This product helps with those issues because the connections are magnetic, and allows for a wide range of mothing at the connector, keeping pressure off the cable itself.The magnets are strong, so the cables don't fall off easily and therefore stay connected.The box contains three different-length braided cables, three USB C adapters, three micro USB adapters, 3 apple type adapters, an organizer for the adapters, a tool to remove the adapters, a tool to remove the adapters, cable ties, and a bag.The instructions state to clean the magnetic connectors, to ensure good contact.I have only used this a few days, we will see how this works over time.",

It protects the charging ports from constant plugging/unplugging and dust build up.2.  I leave the 3 charging cables at various locations in the house (office, kitchen, bedroom, etc). My 9 devices can then connect to any of the 3 cables at anytine, thus not having to deal with separate wall plugs for each device.3.  charging process is so much easier, no more fumbling in the dark. The magnetic cable connect to the tips with a satisfying click.4. The end of the charging cable can swivel 360 degrees & bend to 90 degrees for better convenience & ergonomics. There is a LED at the connector that light blue to indicate power.5.  Reduces cables & wall plugs clutter by consolidation. The same cable can now charges 3 different type of connector.  For example, you can charge an Android phone, then an iPad, and then a flashlight without unplugging or changing anything. One handed operation to connect to a new device and you're done!!!",
