First vehicle I've had with Android Auto support (or Car Play but I haven't owned a iPhone since the iPhone 4, just personal preference).Anyways when I first got it I couldn't not get Android Auto to work. I tried everything I could find online about the problem and you can find plenty of people that have/had trouble getting it to work in their Honda CR-V (ironic since the infotainment system runs on android). Tried doing a full factory reset on the infotainment system, turning on USB debugging in dev settings, and the 2 dif USB type C to USB type A cable I had. No matter it would not work. My phone would charge when plugged in but that's it. A message is supposed to pop up on the infotainment system asking if you want to enable android auto.I bought this cable as a last resort. I made sure to get a USB 2.0 and NOT a USB 3.0 type C to USB type A cable. Didn't think it would make a difference. Got in the car, turned it on, plugged the cable into the car, then into my phone, and BAM the \"do you want to enable android auto\" message instantly pops up on the infotainment system. And it works perfectly. Love it.",

Overall, the cable does its job well, but there are a few aspects worth mentioning.First, let's talk about the positives. The cable functions reliably and effectively connects my USB A devices to my USB C devices. I haven't experienced any connectivity issues or data transfer problems so far, which is crucial when it comes to cables.However, one notable drawback of this cable is its stiff jacket. The cable's outer covering feels rigid and inflexible, making it a bit challenging to maneuver and position as desired. Although this stiffness can be attributed to the cable's durability, it may be a point of concern for those seeking a more flexible and pliable option.That being said, if you're primarily looking for a durable cable that can withstand some wear and tear, this might be a suitable choice for you. The cable's build quality appears to be solid, and it feels sturdy enough to last for an extended period. Just keep in mind that the trade-off for this durability is the cable's rigidity.",

All I know is that I bought this charger as a temporary replacement for my earbud case since the original charger stopped working (and ironically, the charger cables on the official brand site are completely sold out, hence turning to Amazon for a generic one). I have an older, nearly falling apart version of the earbuds that uses a different charger type, and I charge it with a generic charging cable--I haven't had a problem in the 2 years I've been using it. Hence my optimism doing the same for the new earbuds. I opened it as soon as it arrived and everything seemed great. I plugged it into my case and it charged just fine; in fact, it was just what I needed at the start. Cue a couple hours later.I unplugged the case, as it was fully charged, and was using my earbuds when all of a sudden--after about an hour of it being unplugged--there was a LOUD pop, sparks flew out of the case, and it began to smoke. I hurried and disposed of the case because obviously, but was confused because HOW??? The only reasons that come to mind is that the charger and earbud case just weren't compatible or I was sent a faulty charging cable. I don't know, I'm not a battery expert, but I DO know that lithium batteries aren't supposed to randomly explode within an hour of charging them. Just exercise EXTREME caution and monitor your devices if you do decide to purchases this charger, because no one wants lithium batteries to randomly explode in their house.",

I would like a longer charging cable for my iPad Pro and I gambled, since it says it will work with another Apple product, (the MacBook), and lost. The cable might just as well be a piece of string with usb plugs. There is no response of any kind when I plug it in. Even an off brand lightning cable will say \u201cthis device may not work with this cable \u201c. Returning it would just be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Giving it two stars is working on the assumption that it may actually work on \u201cany Type-C enabled device\u201d... except the iPad Pro! So, be careful and don\u2019t get your hopes up. Especially if you want to use it for an Apple product.To be fair I could not find anywhere it said it WOULD work with the iPad Pro. \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1fUPDATE: I does work! The charging cable that came with the iPad is instantly recognized so when I plugged the new one in and it didn\u2019t immediately work I made the mistaken assumption that my new iPad just wouldn\u2019t recognize this Non-Apple cord. It actually takes about 7-8 seconds to wake up and begin charging with this generic cable.So, 7 seconds is just fine with me and assuming it won\u2019t burn out like the old Lightning cables did.I couldn\u2019t be happier.If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!",

Bought 6 foot cord already and now buying more to lay around the house at my desk, sofa, recliner, and in my car. Easier than carrying one set of cords around. Found the 10 foot cord was too long which reduces charging speed, especially when paired up with lower mAh charger, or does not power the device at all. Pair a 10 footer only if you have a high capacity charger. Forget about QI wireless charging which have a higher charging demand. Disadvantage of using cords with plastic type covers vs braided type covers is that they are easier to tangle and inserts wrinkles went tightly wrapped and folded in. I installed a Velcro cord wrap you can buy at a home improvement store to avoid wrinkles when wrapping and storing the cord. The connector tip do break off if you step on them.",

This eliminates the need for me to carry a separate USB-C charger when travelling.NOTE that it will not charge as quickly as a standard USB-C charger with a USB-C cable, but charges quickly enough.Using the \"AMPERE\" phone app, the attached pics show that the AMPERE app measuring the charging of an ALMOST fully charged LG Nexus 5X phone charging at the max rate of 400 mAh with the LG Charger and OEM LG USB-C cable.The other picture showing the max charging rate of 340 mAh is with the Amazon USB-A=> USB-C and a OLYTEK travel charging using the standard USB-A outlet.  So, the AMAZON cable is charging about 85% as quickly as the OEM LG USB-c charger and cable.NOTE 2= when a phone is mostly charged, the charging rate slows down.  If the phone's battery was used up the rates would be much higher.Seems to be of very high quality and the white cables make them easy to locate in a bag.",

If you hold your phone while its plugged in, it will continually drop the cable on you. The rigidity doesn't allow the cable to bend as you move, and forces the connector to flex back and forth making it wiggle out of the port.I have one of these in my car, wired into the dash and comes out at the phone mount. The setup is static and the wire doesn't wiggle free. So, for that setup its perfect.

Whenever I plug it into my cell phone (ZTE MAX) the phone continually \"dings\" on and off because the cable is very loose in the USB C port.  The OEM cable does not cause this to happen, neither does the OEM cable from a Samsung phone I have.I  have several of this brand of charger cable for my Apple products, both with the 30 pin connector and the lightning connector, and always recommend them over any other brand including Apple's branded cables, as these have worked just as good for a fraction of the price, and honestly, have lasted longer than the Apple OEM ones. Which makes me think that this is just an isolated issue.I did not return it because if I use it as a desktop charger, where it's not moving in the vehicle, it does not chime on and off all to often.  I assuming that its because it's stationary and the plug is not wiggling around.I would still recommend buying Amazonbasics cables over the OEM for any manufacturer, and especially over the 100's of non OEM brands from any retailer, as they not only cost more, but in my experciance are subpar, and not orth buying even at 1/2 the cost of the Amazon basics.",

Finally tried this one on the recommendation of some forum I was reading and it works perfectly. Haven't had a disconnect since we got it and it's been over 6 months.",

I have to contort the phone so that the USB-C is at a slight angle to get it to charge at all. Meanwhile, the absurdly short cords still work fine, so I know it's this cord and not my devices.It's not a bad price, and maybe other cords would also fail after about a year.

It'll delay the batteries death until you put it on original charger. But that's fine, cuase as mentioned, I got this to transfer data. This was a good buy, I'd recommend.",

This cable delivered the lowest current to the phone (slowest to charge). The Type-C connector is of low quality. When inserted, it feels like it scratches the internals of the phone port, it is nothing like the original, high-quality connectors from LG, Google or Apple with their smooth but secure click feel.On top of that, Amazon shipped a single cable while I ordered two.

I wouldn't recommend buying if you're not willing to put up with having to wrap the cord around your phone so as to bend it so as to complete the circuit so your phone will charge.  They do charge at a reasonable rate, not as fast as the manufacturer's cord, but if you do keep the cord wrapped up tightly so it will actually charge then it will charge your phone faster than the cheap ones you can buy at your local corner store.  Again, every single cord I bought had this issue, so it is a problem with the cord itself, and they do work but you have to sort of position your cord in a manner so your phone will actually charge.  Do not think it is worth the money, I completely regret purchasing these cords, would buy your other option if it was between these and that.",

I tend to like Amazon Basics, and I think most of their products are good, but I would definitely pass on the chargers next time.

    "text": "USB C devices are beginning to pop up more and more.  Apple Macbook Pros only have USB C , Sony Xperia Phones, even the Nintendo Switch all use USB C. The connector is reversible, allowing you to not having to worry about orientation of the cable before you plug in which is a nice feature.  There are others, but the truth is many USB C to USB A cables are not manufactured correctly resulting in fried devices.  This is scary.  Don\u2019t use a USB C cable that doesn\u2019t have any good reviews.  Amazon Basics have provided many years of decent cables\u2026how does this USB C one hold up?It seems well made, and in line with the other line of cables. We get  black glossy plastic on the connector ends, and a glossy sleeve around the cable itself.  Gold plated connectors. The USB C connector is thin enough to clear the Orzly TPU case on my Xperia X Compact which is appreciated. I tried data transfer which seemed fine but didn\u2019t have the opportunity to check speeds.  The charging capability was where I was concerned about.  Compared to my pack in Sony cable and some good quality ones from Cable Matters, I noticed the Basics cable seemed to charge at a slightly slower rate than those two.  I would get 1400-1500mA (Ampere app )charging through a Qualcom 3.0 charger compared to 2200+ on the other cables.  Results with a standard charger were similar max speeds on both, and a low speed charger also was okay with 750-850mA for either.  If you charge with a regular charger the cable seems to be fine.  I would not use a Quick Charge charger with it though.  The cable has held up well these past three weeks, but time will really tell if it holds up over time. If the cable fails, I will update this review.I give it a 4 out of 5 for now, based on the fact that it did fine in regular charging, but not for Quick Charging.",

I recently bought an Android phone and an Android tablet that both use this newer USB C to Male USB A type plug. I personally love this new standard since there is no flipping and frustration trying to figure out which alignment is correct, and even possible damage while trying to force the plug in the wrong way while in a mental fog. This Basics cord seems to work as well as the original Sony and Google cords my devices shipped with and there has been no, \"slow charging detected\" warning given as when some lower end cords are used. In comparing them with the OEM cords side by side, the cable part themselves seem to be identical. The apparent difference is the housings surrounding the end plugs which are a shiny plastic build as opposed to the softer feeling OEMs and they're also are not quite as substantial as the original products bulk-wise. Using other Basics cables over time in the past, for example to connect my phone to the charger in the car when driving with the Waze GPS app on, the cable needed to be unplugged and reinserted at least twice each day for my daily work commute and after a year of use, still work perfectly and without damage or wear. So the slightly lighter construction seems to still have served it's purpose and function. This cable though costs about half what the OEM's ask on their web sites for the same length, so I opted to save some money with no apparent lose of function, based on previous experience with Basics cables. If you're especially rough with cables, yanking them impatiently for example, you might opt to pay more for OEMs which might be a little more forgiving. But so far for me, extremely happy with all the AmazonBasics products I've gotten the past few years and appreciate the minimal packaging waste they generate as well. Highly recommended.",

As this is my first C-type USB cord I'll admit that perhaps all C-types work flawlessly with data.  However I have amount my cable selection some USB 2 cables that my older Samsung phone would balk at data even as they would work fine as a charging cable.

I find that this one is sturdy and works well.There are a couple of things to look for in a cord.First, it has to work. This one did fine, both in charging and in data transfer.  It all just works right - like a basic cord should. I've had some other vendor cables that didn't charge right, or data transfer right - but this one is great in both areas. Both ends plugged easily into their sockets as well - not too tight or too loose.The second thing is how well it is built. This model is well made - the cord is a nice thick one that won't likely break, and the critical areas around the plugs are reinforced with plastic at the joints (visible in the product pictures).This particular model is almost six feet long, which is great for my tower computer.You should note that I'm using an HTC 10, plugged into either the charger or my Windows computer. So I can't speak to how well it might work in the Mac world.Summary: Like the title says - a basic cable from Amazon. But it works well, looks nice, and is well made. Highly recommended.",

The cords on my tablets give me a lot of trouble. Only one side fits in right and you have to keep trying until you get the right side and since it's still irritating to get the cord in, this requires more than 2 times. Also, they don't seem to last long. With this cord the small end is supposed to fit in the same from either side which would be really nice and it's also supposed to be faster than the average cord. I do wish it was just a little longer though. I know since it's at the computer, you shouldn't need any more than this but if you have a dozen things sitting at your computer to plug in to charge, then a little length helps. I'll sure be glad when the day comes that everything uses the same cord so I don't have at least a dozen laying out here.",

That means charging cables can be a lot more expensive.  This product is insulated like an older, 'normal' USB cable, and data rates are much slower than with the nicer quality cables, but if you're only occasionally transferring files, or they aren't huge files, and you really just need the cable for charging (which is obviously 99% of the use of these things), this is a great choice.Charge speeds were very similar (and extremely fast) if you use this with the appropriate power source.  The cable's not getting hot and I don't think there's any reliability concerns.  If you've just gotten the USB C standard and just need to stock on up simple cables, this is a great choice.

    "text": "Pros-1. Its always advisable to use the charger and the cable which comes with your phone. All manufacturers have the same advice. But there are cases where your in-the-box cable has either gone bad or is too short. In such cases first preference will be to buy a longer charging cable from the same manufacturer (in most cases is not available) but the second preference would be to use AmazonBasics type C cable. You ask why?2. Well As compared to other \"good\" brands which carry a 6 month warranty on charger and cable, AmazonBasics Carries a 1 year warranty - this is lesser known and even lesser advertised assurance.3. Let's say you manage to buy a branded charging cable which does offer you 1 year warranty, try claiming the warranty and you will soon realize how tedious the entire procedure is to get a replacement. Visit a nearby service centre, get your receipt and all the stories to let you down. In frustration, you would rather go and buy a new cable! Unlike this, I have experienced that one my type C charging cable from amazonbasics wasn't charging after around 10months. This is where you get to witness Amazon's superior hassle free service. You just call amazon and inform them of the issue, and a replacement is sent - no questions asked. The older cable can be given to the person who comes for delivery (no original box needed as well). Is there any brand which provides such a stellar service? I don't think so! Hence this is my #1 reason to recommend amazonbasics type c charging cable than any other brand! I wonder why others who have provided a very negative review have not exercised this 1 year warranty claim?4. The other good aspect of amazonbasics type C is (tried and tested) it works seamlessly with my Samsung S8 and A8+. No issues with fast / quick charging ! Some cables may come cheaper but beware that there is more to the wire \"inside\" than just the looks and the cost! You may end up destroying the circuitry of your premium phone in the bargain if you compromise on the charging cable or charger.5. As with fast charging, it Also does fast data transfer!6. I recommend a longer cable than the default size which comes with the phone since its easy to connect to a nearby port and sit on your chair or sofa and keep using the phone. Always use a slightly longer cable than what you need to ensure that the cable does not stretch at its joint and ultimately peels off. Many reviews and photos of this can be evidenced!Cons-1. A nylon braided cable would have been preferred if such an option would have been available, though I know its slightly expensive. Non braided cables tend to tangle, the longer they are unless you have purchased separately an accessory (wire clip - check pic) to tie the cable in place for storage.**Warning -This is a type A USB to type C USB cable (see pic), so if you have a Type C to Type C USB cable for your google phone, then this is not for you!",

El color blanco a mi parecer es m\u00e1s bonito que los normales en negro, adem\u00e1s por el super ofert\u00f3n que aprovech\u00e9 al pagar $186 pesos por CINCO cables de 1.8 metros cada uno no me puedo quejar de ninguna maneral.Uno lo uso en el auto para aprovechar Android Auto y el otro con el cargador original de Samsung para usar el Wireless Charger Duo y cero problemas. Lo intent\u00e9 usar con otro USB C que ten\u00eda y no me permit\u00eda cargar, pero con estos de Amazon el problema se resolvi\u00f3. No hay m\u00e1s que decir, la longitud es fant\u00e1stica aunque a veces estorba estar enroll\u00e1ndolo en el auto porque s\u00f3lo uso una parte cuando respondo alg\u00fan mensaje bien dice el dicho que m\u00e1s vale que sobre y no que falte.Muchas veces ha usado mi copiloto el cel y obviamente no nos preocupamos porque el cable se estire o se desconecte y ah\u00ed es donde resulta muy \u00fatil. He flasheado un par de veces una Note 10+ y \u00faltimamente un S20+ y aunque recomiendan usar siempre el cable original usando este de AmazonBasics no hubo nada de problema. Te transmite seguridad que el grosor del cable es muy bueno y tambi\u00e9n r\u00e1pido piensas que te va a durar mucho, lo cual he comprobado en esos seis meses que llevo usando apenas dos de los cinco.",

I've only had it a few weeks so wouldn't want to comment on durability but it seems very sturdy and I hope it will go the distance. I've bought way to many \"official\" cables off eBay and Amazon in the past for very low prices and inevitably after a little while you have to mess around or stand your phone up at a funny angle to get them to work at all.I have been using this cable with an official Samsung fast charger and it has worked brilliantly. I have been able to charge my phone from low battery to full in a little over an hour which is great. I have also used it with a Samsung wireless fast charge dock which seems to be a little slower but still does the job in a very quick time, and you've got that extra wireless element to it.All in all a great cable... I have trusted AmazonBasics stuff in the past and it has not let me down. It isn't always the cheapest but is always reasonably priced. If it's something I'm going to be using on occasion I will maybe take a chance on a random brand but for something like this which will have daily use AmazonBasics is an easy choice! Highly recommended!Thanks for reading my review, I hope it was helpful in some way!",

Im nkt 100% sure about the data transfer date, but basically, I was having to use my ssd hard drive cable for my ps5 controller, and for my tablet because those just didnt last. Or, i have 1 that only works with my ps5 controller. But yeah, if u need a very long usb c cable, amazon jave you covered! Only took 7 days to deliver. And its so long! 2.7 metres? Way more than i expected \ud83d\ude02 So, if you need a cable that works. For the price u cannot beat it! If you can, it probably wont work on all devices.

But this Amazon basics one will enable the fast charger to fast charge with the longer length allowing me to sit comfortably on the sofa whilst its plugged in charging. With the original cable that came with my phone it was onky 1m long and I has to twist round at an uncomfortable angle on the sofa as the phone would only reach so far. But now Im happy.One criticism is that I think it should be less expensive being as it is meant to be an Amazon bascics item, but the quality is good.Thanks for reading,Milesfb.",

It's only been a month, but so far it's been the best one to handle the kind of messed up charging habit and environment I put it through. I use my phone while charging, while laying on the bed and I move around, alot. Given all that, it still has not given up. Which means that it's internals are pretty well made. Solidly built.And given than most of the type C cables that I bought are within the same price range or slightly less,this is, so far the best.

Prezzo trovato molto conveniente, 5.91\u20ac a aprile 2019, quindi davvero un'ottima occasione.Il cavo \u00e8 arrivato integro, perfetto, arrotolato dentro la sua scatolina.Esternamente alla confezione, un'etichetta ne descrive il contenuto e la fabbricazione (Prodotto in Cina).Provandolo a scopo ricarica dico subito che si tratta di un cavo di tutto rispetto, mi sembra anche pi\u00f9 robusto dell\"originale. Il connettore entra perfettamente, \u00e8 facile da inserire e si aggancia bene (insomma il click si sente quando entra e ricarica perfettamente).Come velocit\u00e0 di trasferimento dati immagino che una versione superiore potrebbe far meglio (la 2.0 ha velocit\u00e0 di trasferimento massima di 480\u00a0Mb/s) ma, per le mie necessit\u00e0, basta e avanza.In sintesi, cavo perfetto per le mie esigenze di ricarica cellulare, lunghezza per 1,8 m, robusto e flessibile. Rapporto qualit\u00e0 - prezzo ottimo...e poi, come sempre, vuoi mettere la comodit\u00e0 di una consegna a casa in 24 ore!? Ciao!",

Picked up as an add-on item for $6.99 recently, although I see it has jumped up to $15.99 as of 5/17.  Not sure why such a wild price swing.  At $6.99, good value.  At $15.99, value is questionable.  At the higher price point, you'd probably be better off with an Anker product.  You get higher quality and a better warranty (and a company that backs it) for similar, or even lower pricing.

I thought my phone was at fault, my fake \"OnePlus\" cable that I got for cheap didn't support fast charge, thus leaving me with pathetic slow charging options. My stock cable used to charge my phone fine with a 1.5A Samsung charger until a day ago when my phone to boot loop again. Now, my PC won't recognize my phone anymore and upon fiddling my phone was shut down. I saw this cable on lightning sale. I bought it with closed eyes thinking even if it's my faulty phone, I can use it in future.To my surprise, it worked. I was overwhelmed.QUALITYThe USB-C port has the right dimensions, unlike cheap cables. I can feel the click. The Wire is not very thick but the quality is good, feels like some expensive OEM cable. I can use my phone while charging without having to worry about it getting snapped out. I'm not sure about its longevity, but it should last longer than those cheap knock-offs.FAST-CHARGINGIt works flawlessly, may be it is a certified cable (need to check that). My phone went 18 to 85 percent in approx. 45 minutes before the trickle charging kicked in.DATA SYNC:I could sync my files between phone and PC without any issues.I bought it off Amazon prime sale, it was delivered to me after 15 hours.Thank you Amazon!",

Even apple cables tend to break at the joints near connectors but these are as good as day one...Recently, i noticed that the phone was not charging properly, so I cleaned the connector and boom they are back to being flawless.I would totally recommend buying this Amazon basics cable,  there are multiple other cables from quantum, ambrane, intex, boat, rock...etc none of them are as good as these, trust me I have used most of them...Though these might be expensive than the other competitors, they are definitely worth the premium..",

Ma se ve ne serve uno per uso quotidiano e avete la possibilit\u00e0 di spendere un poco di pi\u00f9, vi consiglio assolutamente altro. In primis, la porta USB-A \u00e8 in standard 2.0, e non 3.1 come l'ultimo uscito. Questo si traduce in una minore velocit\u00e0 nello scambio dati in caso si colleghi il dispositivo ad un computer, la velocit\u00e0 di ricarica invece rimane la medesima. Secondo, per qualit\u00e0 del cavo in s\u00e9. Non \u00e8 in tessuto intrecciato, quindi risulta meno robusto rispetto a tali varianti. Ne consiglio l'acquisto solo a chi vuole risparmiare il massimo per avere una dotazione di cavetteria da \"backup\" per quelli che usa regolarmente, altrimenti vi conviene optare per un cavo USB-C USB-A ma a standard 3.1 e in tessuto cos\u00ec da guadagnarci in performance e robustezza.

Da bei diesen Smartphones das Geh\u00e4use speziell gegen Wassereintritt und staub gesch\u00fctzt ist, ist der Bereich zum Einf\u00fchren des Kabels enger angelegt als bei normalen Smartphones. Daher k\u00f6nnen nur bestimmte Typ C Kabel genutzt werden. Da nur 1 Kabel beim Smartphone dabei war, wollte ich nat\u00fcrlich ein Ersatz-Kabel und testete verschiedene Kabel aus. Das Kabel von Amazon Basics passt hierbei genau und war das Einzige (von 5 Kabeln), das richtig passte. Das Kabel macht einen stabilen Eindruck und hat bereits mehrere Touren in einer engen Tasche ohne Probleme \u00fcberstanden. Ich kann es daher absolut empfehlen vor Allem, wenn man besitzer eines Outdoor-Smartphones ist.",
